*Purpose*: Learning to do EDA well takes practice! In this challenge
you’ll further practice EDA by first completing a guided exploration,
then by conducting your own investigation. This challenge will also give
you a chance to use the wide variety of visual tools we’ve been
learning.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is
an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state
of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a
hype-driven media cycle, and promote a “fact-based worldview” by
focusing on data. The dataset we’ll study in this challenge is from
Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we’ll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to
the high-level process we’re going through—after this guided round
you’ll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

### **q0** Perform your “first checks” on the dataset. What variables are in this

dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Do your "first checks" here!
gapminder %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 1,704

``` r
gapminder %>%

    ## 

**Observations**:

- country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble.
(Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

``` r
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <- gapminder %>% pull(year) %>% max()
year_min <- gapminder %>% pull(year) %>% min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document
your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you
can.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent,gdpPercap))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Oceania has the highest median GDP per capia
- Asia and America have outliers that are outside the whiskers of the
  box plots.

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

- I tried graphing by country as first which made the graph unreadable.
- I tried graphing with out log scale and found that the differences
  were not possibel to figure out.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

``` r
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2
outlier_Asia <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Asia') %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  first()
outlier_America <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Americas') %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  top_n(2)
```

    ## Selecting by gdpPercap

``` r
outlier_Asia
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   country continent  year lifeExp    pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>   <fct>     <int>   <dbl>  <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Kuwait  Asia       1952    55.6 160000   108382.

``` r
outlier_America
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 6
    ##   country       continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>         <fct>     <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 United States Americas   1952    68.4 157553000    13990.
    ## 2 Canada        Americas   1952    68.8  14785584    11367.

**Observations**:

- Identify the outlier countries from q2
  - Kuwait, United States, Canada

*Hint*: For the next task, it’s helpful to know a ggplot trick we’ll
learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside
any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom
only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to
label:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/layer-filter-1.png)<!-- -->

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We’ve learned a lot of different ways to show multiple
variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == min(year)|year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_grid(vars(year))+
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United States", "Canada", "Kuwait")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Kuwait is no longer an outlier in 2007 despite having been an outlier
  in 1952.
- The United States and Canada are still outliers in both 1952 and 2007.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP
per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers,
consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider
the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

``` r
## TASK: Your first graph
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == '1952'|year == '1977') %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(year))+
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United States", "Vietnam")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task1-1.png)<!-- -->

- Question: What happens to lifespan before and after the Vietnam War in
  countries that participated?
- From before the Vietnam war to after the Vietnam war the life
  expectancy in Vietnam increased while staying around the 1st quartile.
- In 1952, the United States was the maximum life expectancy in the
  Americas while after the Vietnam War, they were no longer the maximum.
- Soviet Union was not included due to not being in the data set.

``` r
## TASK: Your second graph
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == 'Kuwait') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line() 
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task2-1.png)<!-- -->

- Question: What happened to the Kuwait GDP between 1952 and 2007? -The
  Kuwait GDP per capita decreased sharply in the year 1977.
- The increase in 1972 and then sharp fall in 1977 is assicoated with
  the stock market crash in Kuwait.

``` r
## TASK: Your third graph
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year,continent) %>%
  summarize(pop=sum(pop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year,pop,color = continent))+
  geom_line()
```

    ## `summarise()` has regrouped the output.
    ## ℹ Summaries were computed grouped by year and continent.
    ## ℹ Output is grouped by year.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.groups = "drop_last")` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.by = c(year, continent))` for per-operation grouping
    ##   (`?dplyr::dplyr_by`) instead.

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task3-1.png)<!-- -->

- What happens to the world population over time?
- The population increased over time.
- The amount of the world population in Asia increased over time.
